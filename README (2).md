"Classify Arabic text as human or AI-generated"
# Human vs AI Text Classification

This project presents a binary text classification system that distinguishes between human-written and AI-generated Arabic texts.

## 📌 Overview
With the rise of generative AI models like GPT2, it's becoming harder to differentiate between real and synthetic content. This project explores a deep learning approach using hybrid architectures (GPT2 + LSTM / BiLSTM, AraBERT + LSTM) to tackle this challenge.

## 📂 Dataset
- A balanced dataset of ~87,000 Arabic tweets.
- Human-written texts were collected from real Twitter accounts.
- AI-generated texts were synthesized using `akhooli/gpt2-small-arabic`.

## 🧠 Models Used
- **GPT2 + LSTM**
- **GPT2 + BiLSTM**
- **AraBERT + LSTM**

## 🎯 Goal
To build a classifier that can accurately detect whether a given Arabic sentence was written by a human or generated by a model like GPT.

## 📈 Results
GPT2 + BiLSTM achieved the highest validation accuracy (99.67%) and lowest loss.

## 🚫 Note
The dataset used in this project is not publicly available, as it was provided for research purposes by a private source.
